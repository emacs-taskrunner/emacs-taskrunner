;;; taskrunner.el --- Retrieve build system/taskrunner tasks  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2019 Yavor Konstantinov

;; Author: Yavor Konstantinov <ykonstantinov1 AT gmail DOT com>
;; URL: https://github.com/emacs-taskrunner/emacs-taskrunner
;; Version: 0.6
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "25.1") (projectile "2.0.0") (async "1.9.3"))
;; Keywords: build-system taskrunner build task-runner tasks convenience

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:
;; This package aims to provide a library which can be used to retrieve tasks
;; from several build systems and task runners.  The output produced can then be
;; leveraged to create interactive user interfaces(helm/ivy for example) which
;; will let the user select a task to be ran.

;;;; Installation

;;;;; MELPA

;; If you installed from MELPA, then make sure to also install one of the
;; available frontends for this.  They are:
;; - ivy-taskrunner <- Uses ivy as a frontend
;; - helm-taskrunner <- Uses helm as a frontend
;; - ido-taskrunner <- Uses Ido as a frontend

;;;;; Manual

;; Install these required packages:

;; projectile
;; async
;; cl-lib
;; And one or more of these:
;; - ivy-taskrunner <- Uses ivy as a frontend
;; - helm-taskrunner <- Uses helm as a frontend
;; - ido-taskrunner <- Uses Ido as a frontend

;; Then put this folder in your load-path, and put this in your init:

;; (require 'taskrunner)

;;;; Usage

;; Please see README for more details on the interfaces and customizable options
;; available.  This package is not meant to be used itself unless you are
;; developing a new frontend or would like to retrieve information about the
;; available tasks in a project/directory.

;;;; Credits

;; This package would not have been possible without the following
;; packages:
;; grunt.el[1] which helped me retrieve the tasks from grunt
;; gulp-task-runner[2] which helped me retrieve the tasks from gulp
;; helm-make[3] which helped me figure out the regexps needed to retrieve
;;              makefile targets
